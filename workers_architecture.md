# DALL-E Android App Worker Architecture

## Overview
This document outlines the worker deployment strategy for the DALL-E Android app to handle background operations efficiently.

## Worker Types

### 1. Image Processing Worker
- **Purpose**: Handle image filters and transformations asynchronously
- **Queue**: In-memory queue with persistence fallback
- **Priority**: High for user-initiated operations

### 2. API Request Worker
- **Purpose**: Manage DALL-E API calls with retry logic
- **Features**: 
  - Rate limiting (50 requests/minute)
  - Automatic retry with exponential backoff
  - Request batching for efficiency

### 3. Cache Management Worker
- **Purpose**: Clean up old images and manage storage
- **Schedule**: Runs every 6 hours or on low memory
- **Strategy**: LRU (Least Recently Used) eviction

### 4. Settings Sync Worker
- **Purpose**: Handle export/import operations
- **Features**:
  - Automatic backup on settings change
  - Cloud sync preparation (future feature)

### 5. Gallery Indexing Worker
- **Purpose**: Update image metadata and thumbnails
- **Triggers**: New image generation, filter application

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Workers (Current Priority)
1. Image Processing Worker for Task 3 (Image Filters)
2. Settings Sync Worker for Task 4 (Export/Import)

### Phase 2: Enhancement Workers
3. API Request Worker optimization
4. Cache Management Worker
5. Gallery Indexing Worker

## Technical Stack
- **Threading**: Python threading module for Kivy compatibility
- **Queue**: queue.Queue for thread-safe operations
- **Persistence**: JSON for settings, SQLite for metadata
- **Scheduling**: APScheduler for periodic tasks
