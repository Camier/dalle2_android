## WORKER SYSTEM VERIFICATION

## ANDROID INTEGRATION VERIFICATION
✅ Correctly implemented - Touch Event Handling
  Implementation: MaskCanvas with on_touch_down/move/up
✅ Correctly implemented - Image Storage
  Implementation: app_storage_path() for Android
✅ All required permissions requested - Permissions
  Implementation: request_permissions in main.py
⚠️ Consider adding memory optimization - Memory Management

## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. 🔧 Address failing checks to achieve full API compliance
2. 📍 Implement all three DALL-E 2 endpoints: generations, variations, edits
3. 🚨 Add comprehensive error handling with retry logic
4. ⏱️ Implement proper rate limiting per OpenAI specifications
5. 💾 Save generated images locally to avoid regeneration
6. 🔄 Use response_format='b64_json' for direct image manipulation
7. 📏 Validate image dimensions before API calls
8. 🎨 For edits, ensure mask has transparent areas for modification
9. 📝 Keep prompts under 1000 characters for DALL-E 2
10. 🔐 Never expose API keys in client-side code
11. 📊 Implement usage tracking for cost management
12. 🖼️ Support all three sizes: 256x256, 512x512, 1024x1024
13. ⚡ Use batch processing where possible
14. 🛡️ Implement content moderation before generation
15. 📱 Implement image size reduction for mobile
16. 🎨 Add gesture support for mask drawing (pinch to zoom)
17. 💾 Use Android's MediaStore for gallery integration
18. 🔄 Implement background service for long operations
19. 📶 Add offline queue for poor connectivity
20. 🖼️ Optimize PNG compression for smaller APK
21. ⚡ Use hardware acceleration for image processing
22. 📊 Add analytics for feature usage tracking

## OFFICIAL OPENAI PATTERNS REFERENCE
Based on OpenAI Cookbook examples:
- Image generation with prompt
- Image variations from existing image
- Image edits with mask (inpainting/outpainting)
- Proper error handling and retries
- Rate limiting per model type
- Base64 encoding for direct manipulation
