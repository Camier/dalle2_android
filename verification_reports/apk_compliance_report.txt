## RECOMMENDATIONS
1. 📱 Test on multiple Android versions (API 21-33)
2. 🏗️ Use arm64-v8a for modern devices
3. 📦 Keep APK size under 25MB for better distribution
4. 🔐 Sign release APKs with proper keystore
5. ⚡ Enable ProGuard/R8 for release builds
6. 📊 Use Android Studio Profiler for performance
7. 🧪 Implement unit tests with pytest
8. 📝 Add comprehensive logging for debugging
9. 🌐 Handle offline scenarios gracefully
10. 🔄 Implement proper state management
11. 🎯 Use variant-specific configurations
12. 🔧 Leverage AGP's artifact API for transformations
13. 📦 Implement dependency substitution for testing
14. 🏃 Enable configuration caching for faster builds
15. 🔍 Use lint checks for code quality
16. 📊 Generate build reports for optimization

## BUILDOZER BEST PRACTICES
1. Always use virtual environment
2. Pin dependency versions
3. Test on physical devices
4. Monitor build logs for warnings
5. Use release mode for production
6. Implement proper error handling
7. Follow Material Design guidelines
8. Optimize images and assets
9. Implement proper permissions flow
10. Test on different screen sizes

## ANDROID GRADLE PATTERNS REFERENCE
Based on Android Gradle Recipes:
- Use onVariants for variant configuration
- Implement artifact transformations
- Leverage finalizeDsl for DSL modifications
- Use registerPreBuild for validation
- Implement proper signing configuration
- Use build features selectively
